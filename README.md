Project Description:
This Flutter app integrates the Gemini API to generate dynamic color values based on natural language descriptions. Users can input color descriptions like "sunset orange" or "sky blue," and the app will generate the corresponding RGB color values, displaying the colors in real-time.

Key Features:
- Color Generation: Uses the Gemini API to generate RGB values from user-provided color descriptions.

- Real-time Updates: Implements streaming responses to show the generated color instantly.

- Context Synchronization: Maintains context across multiple user interactions for more relevant responses.

- User-Friendly UI: Simple and intuitive interface to input color descriptions and view results.

Technologies Used:
- Flutter: For building the cross-platform mobile app.

- Gemini API: For generating dynamic color values based on natural language descriptions.

- Firebase: For user authentication and storing data.
